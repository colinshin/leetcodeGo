package sort

// Search uses binary search to find and return the smallest index i
// in [from, to) at which f(i) is true, assuming that on the range [from, to),
// f(i) == true implies f(i+1) == true. That is, Search requires that
// f is false for some (possibly empty) prefix of the input range [from, to)
// and then true for the (possibly empty) remainder; Search returns
// the first true index. If there is no such index, Search returns n.
// It is just another version of the same name function in standard lib, package sort.
// this version is a little different of parameters
